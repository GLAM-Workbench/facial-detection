Notebooks include:

* **Finding faces in the Tribune collection** — Using OpenCV for basic facial detection.
* **Finding all the faces in the Tribune collection** — Runs the detection script over all 60,000 images, crops faces, and saves the data.
* **Exploring the face data** — Having a look at the data on the number of faces per image.
* **Make all the faces into one big image** — A very, very big image...
* **Focus on faces** — A little app that fades from faces to photos...

Some results:

* [Faces of the Tribune](https://easyzoom.com/image/127772) — all the faces as one big, deep zoomable image
* [Focus on faces](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/GLAM-Workbench/facial-detection/master?urlpath=%2Fapps%2Ffocus-on-faces.ipynb) — a Jupyter powered app
* [Faces of the Tribune](https://2018.exploringdigitalheritage.net/uncategorized/faces-of-the-tribune/) — a pop-up exhibition
* [faces_per_image.csv](faces_per_image.csv) — extracted face data
